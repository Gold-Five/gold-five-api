# Gold-Five API Backend

## Overview

This repository contains the backend API service for the Gold-Five full-stack web application. The backend is implemented using ASP.NET Web API and provides structured endpoints that support client-side interaction and persistent data management.

The system emphasizes modular architecture, separation of concerns, and engineering reliability. Rather than focusing solely on functionality, the project demonstrates maintainable system design and scalable backend structure.

---

## System Architecture

The backend follows a layered architecture that separates responsibilities across distinct components:

- **API Layer** — exposes RESTful endpoints for communication with the frontend
- **Domain Layer** — encapsulates business logic and validation rules
- **Data Layer** — manages persistence and database interaction

This architecture promotes clarity, modularity, and testability while allowing components to evolve independently. The design reflects core software engineering principles such as abstraction, maintainability, and system scalability.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints
- CRUD operations for application data
- domain-level validation and logic separation
- persistent data storage
- unit testing for core logic
- structured backend integration with frontend clients
- support for secure API communication

---

## Running the API

### Requirements

- .NET SDK installed

### Setup & Execution


Once running, the API exposes endpoints for frontend communication and data interaction.

---

## Testing

Unit tests are implemented to validate business logic, boundary conditions, and system behavior. Automated testing improves reliability and ensures predictable outcomes during development.

Run tests using:

## Frontend Integration

This backend API is designed to operate with the Gold-Five frontend web interface:

Together, the frontend and backend repositories form a complete full-stack system that demonstrates client-server interaction, layered architecture, and modern web engineering practices.

## Technical Reflection

This project highlights principles of layered backend design, API abstraction, and structured data flow. It reinforces the importance of modularity, testing discipline, and separation of concerns in scalable software systems. The experience reflects a system-oriented approach to backend engineering rather than isolated feature implementation.
